      <h2>Condition-Controlled Loops</h2>

      <p>We do not always know the exact number of times to iterate through a loop. This is a common situation when the
        end-user is in charge of letting the program know when they are done with data entry. As a developer, your job
        is to write the program that will loop until a predetermined value, such as &ldquo;quit&rdquo;, is read. The
        predetermined value is known as a sentinel.
      </p>


      <h3>Stop on a Sentinel</h3>

      <p>sen&#8226;ti&#8226;nel </p>

      <p>Definition: (noun)...a soldier or guard whose job is to stand and keep watch.</p>

      <p>The term <b>sentinel</b> in programming means a special value that a program is looking for and when
        encountered, take certain actions. Here are some examples.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>A program that asks a user to enter words until the entered word is, &ldquo;quit&rdquo;.</li>
        <li>A program that performs security scans on a hard drive every half hour until midnight, it then outputs a
          report for the previous day and starts over.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Below is a Java code snippet that uses the <code class="keyword">while</code> loop with a sentinel. I encourage
        you to type the code into your development environment AND make it work. Remember to read my comments as they
        help you understand the concepts.
      </p>

      <pre><code class="java">
private void getCities() {

  //IMPORTANT you need to have a condition to check
  //make sure you get the condition OUTSIDE of the while loop
  //make sure you give the opportunity to change the condition INSIDE 
  //of the while loop
  
  Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
  String city = "N";
  final String QUIT = "Q";

  System.out.println("Please enter a city that you have lived in.");
  System.out.println("When you want to quit, just enter 'Q' for quit");
  System.out.println();

  //IMPORTANT, you must get the &quot;condition&quot; OUTSIDE of the loop first
  //the &quot;condition&quot; is stored in the variable city
  //I use nextLine to capture cities with spaces in them

  city = input.nextLine();

  //IMPORTANT notice the ! The ! (not operator) means negate the statement.
  //the signature of this while loop says:
  //as long as the city is NOT equal to the value of the 
  //named constant QUIT, keep going
  
  while(!city.equalsIgnoreCase(QUIT)){
    //order matters
    System.out.println(&quot;I like &quot; + city);
    System.out.println(&quot;Please enter another city or 'Q' to quit&quot;);

    //IMPORTANT, use the built in Scanner method .nextLine() 
    //just in case the city has a space in its name

      city = input.nextLine();

  } //end while

  System.out.println(&quot;Thank you!&quot;);

}//end of method
</code></pre>

      <p>Below is a sample output for the code above. Please read through the output to insure it is what you expected.
      </p>


      <pre class="output">

	Hello, I would like to know the cities you have lived in
	When prompted, please enter a city or 'Q' to quit
	
	Please enter a city that you have lived in.
	When you want to quit, just enter 'Q' for quit

	River Falls
	I like River Falls 
	
	Please enter another city or 'Q' to quit
	Las Vegas
	I like Las Vegas

	Please enter another city or 'Q' to quit
	q
	
	Thank you!

</pre>

      <h3 id="guess_number">Using Two Sentinels</h3>

      <p>Sometimes you need two sentinels; one to solve the problem and one to allow the end-user to just quit.With a
        method such as <code>guessMyNumber()</code>, the end-user may get tired of playing before they actually guess
        the number. By providing a &ldquo;quit&rdquo; sentinel, you allow the end-user to gracefully end the program.
        However, you also need to watch for the magic number to award fabulous prizes.
      </p>

      <p>Below is a Java code snippet that uses the <code class="keyword">while</code> loop with two sentinels. Study
        the code and my comments carefully. Ask questions if you do not fully understand this fundamental concept. I
        encourage you to type the code into your development environment AND make it work.</p>

      <p>Notice that I use a decision structure to validate the end-user input. Remember, never trust end-user input.
        Always validate. Please study the code below.</p>

      <pre><code class="java">
private void guessMyNumber() {

//IMPORTANT you need to have a condition to check
//make sure you get the condition OUTSIDE of the while loop
//make sure you give the opportunity to change the condition INSIDE 
//the while loop

  Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
  int guess = 0;
  String userInput = &quot;&quot;;
  final int QUIT = 99;
  final int FAV_NUM = 57;

  System.out.println(&quot;Please enter a number.&quot;);
  System.out.println(&quot;If you get tired of guessing and you want&quot; +
		&quot; to quit, just enter 99&quot;);
		
  System.out.println();
	
//Remember end-user validation? 
//I use .next() and save the end-user's input into a String variable. 
//Because this is safe...your program will not crash. A String can
//hold a series of any characters, including numbers.

  userInput = input.next();

//Use a regular expression &quot;[0-9]+&quot; to see if the end-user input matches
//the numbers 0-9. The + signs means the number can occur more than once.
      
  if(userInput.matches(&quot;[0-9]+&quot;)){
	
  //IMPORTANT, you must get the &quot;condition&quot; OUTSIDE of the loop first
  //the "condition" needs to be stored in the variable guess, but we saved
  //it into a String variable named userInput. Not to worry...parse it!
  //It is safe to parse userInput because we validated it to be a number
  //using the regular expression in our decision structure
  
   guess = Integer.parseInt(userInput);

//IMPORTANT notice the ! The ! (not operator) means negate the statement.
//the signature of this while loop says:
//as long as the guess is NOT equal to FAV_NUM AND it is NOT equal to 
//the value of QUIT, keep going

    while(guess != FAV_NUM &amp;&amp; guess != QUIT ){
      //order matters
      System.out.println(&quot;Sorry, that is not correct&quot;);
      System.out.println(&quot;Please try again or enter 99 to quit&quot;);

      //NEVER trust end-user input. VALIDATE again

      userInput = input.next();

      if(userInput.matches(&quot;[0-9]+&quot;)){
        guess = Integer.parseInt(userInput);
      }
      else{
        break; //get out of the loop
      }
		
    }//end of while
   
  }//end of if(userInput.matches)
  
  if(guess == FAV_NUM){
	System.out.println(&quot;Wow, you guessed it.&quot;);
  }
  else{
	//under which conditions does this statement run?
	System.out.println(&quot;Bye! Come back soon.&quot;);
  }
  
}//end of method
</code></pre>

      <p class="notice">Remember the logical AND ( &amp;&amp; ) operator? In our <code class="keyword">while</code>
        loop, both conditions MUST reconcile to <code class="keyword">true</code> in order for the loop to run. The
        conditions read, &ldquo;is it true that <code>guess</code> is not equal to the value of FAV_NUM <i>and</i> is it
        true that <code>guess</code> is not equal to the value of QUIT.&rdquo; In this example, we use the same variable
        on both sides of the condition. Pay attention to the data types!</p>


      <h3>Things to Remember</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Using a sentinel puts the end-user in control</li>
        <li>You need to have a condition to check</li>
        <li>Make sure you establish the value of the variable being tested <b>BEFORE</b> you enter the <code
            class="keyword">while</code> loop</li>
        <li>To avoid an infinite loop, make sure you give the opportunity to <b>change the condition INSIDE</b> of the
          <code class="keyword">while</code> loop.</li>
        <li>Never trust end-user input, always validate.</li>
        <li>This chapter featured condition-controlled loops using the <code class="keyword">while</code> loop, however,
          you could solve the same problems using a <code class="keyword">do/while</code> loop.</li>
        <li>The regular expression featured on this page is handy for validating whole numbers</li>
      </ul>




      <h3>What's Next</h3>
      <p>After carefully reviewing the code snippets on this page, go to the chapter on
        <a href="repetition_with_decision.html">Combining Repetition Structures and Decision Structures</a>. After all,
        the sample code on this page gave you a preview.
