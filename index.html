				<h3>Overview</h3>
				<p>My Program Logic website is your textbook. It contains learning units, as well as other resources, including links to videos, websites and handy documents. I recommend you bookmark and become familiar with this website. This page is referred to as the landing page or top-level index page of my website. When you type in the URL, you land on this page. If my website or any links on my website are not available, please do not assume I already know; instead, contact me immediately.
				</p>
				
				<blockquote>&quot;It is our attitude at the beginning of a difficult task which, more than anything else, will affect its successful outcome.&quot; - William James</blockquote>
				
				<h3>Learning Strategies</h3>
				
				<!-- <p>Hopefully this website is viewable on a range of screen sizes and is accessible to everyone. Some browsers, like Firefox, have a "reader view" option. Once in this view, you can listen to my web pages. However, many of my web pages contain images, sample code, or charts, which you should thoroughly study. 
				</p> -->
				
				<p>Your learning will be greatly enhanced if you accomplish the following:</p>
				
				<ul>
                    <li>Review unit chapters before attempting assignments</li>
					<li>Ask questions and seek my help</li>
					<li>Use the Program Logic Software Development Standards</li>
					<li>Start assignments early</li>
					<li>Review my feedback on all of your assignments</li>
					<li>Fix any issues before attempting the next unit or assignment</li>
					<li>View all assigned videos</li>
					<li>Listen to any assigned podcast</li>
					<li>Thoroughly review code examples, including my comments</li>
					<li>Download, import, run, and step-through any available Java code</li>
					<li>Create working NetBeans projects from code snippets</li>
				</ul>

                <p>To enhance your learning, I have provided many resources for you to review. There are pages in this website that include <mark>interactive learning activities</mark>, as well as pages with <mark>solution algorithms and sample code</mark>. Additional resources are located in Blackboard&#8482;, which is our learning management system. These resources include, videos, podcast, and sample code. </p>

                <p>While reviewing this website and my sample code, please keep in mind that my variable, class, and method names do not always follow our Software Development Standards. This is done for clarity in learning. You are required to follow our standards. </p>
			
                <p><a href="#top">Top</a></p>

				<h3>Navigating this Website</h3>
				
				<p>You should be able to view and navigate this website on a variety of screen sizes. If you cannot effectively navigate my website and/or view any of its resources, please contact me immediately. Links labeled &ldquo;Top&rdquo; take you up to the top of the page. If you are on another web page, you can easily return to this page by clicking on the words &ldquo;Program Logic&rdquo; which are in the top right-hand corner of all web pages in this website.</p>
				
                <p>I encourage you become familiar my web pages <a href="muddy_points/index.html">Answers to Common Questions</a> and <a href="pl_standards/index.html">Program Logic Software Development Standards</a>,  both found under the <code><b>Handy Pages</b></code> link on the menu. Links listed under <code><b>Learning Units</b></code> take you to the landing page (index) for a specific learning unit. Each landing page has links to individual pages within that unit. 
				</p>

                
				 
				 <h3>Due Dates and Assignment Submission</h3>
				 
				 <p>Assignments encompass concepts learned in an entire learning unit. Please carefully review all chapters in a learning unit before attempting its assignment. Submit your assignments via our learning management system called Blackboard. Assignment resources, details, and due dates are in Blackboard. Please ask for help sooner rather than later. 
				</p>
				
				 <p>
				 Assignments are due by 11:59PM on the posted due date. I do not accept assignments past the due date unless there is a pre-approved good reason. This means you need to communicate with me and again, please ask for help sooner rather than later. 
				 </p>
                 <p id="tests"><a href="#top">Top</a></p> 				
				<h3>Basic Grading Information, Quizzes, and Tests</h3>
				
				<p>Total points for each assignment are listed in Blackboard in the assignment folder. Assignments may include a rubric which will be used for grading purposes. All rubrics will be in Blackboard. Assignments may include a test plan which will be used for grading purposes. All test plans will be in Blackboard. Please see my course syllabus in Blackboard for detailed grading information.
				</p>

				<p>Low point quizzes are designed to test your knowledge before attempting the assignment. These quizzes may be taken as many times as necessary to obtain 100%. The quizzes are available in Blackboard.</p>

				<p>With the exception of the final exam, tests may be taken up to two times. The last score will be used as your grade. These tests are part of your over-all grade. The test are available in Blackboard.</p>

                       <p> Many of the learning units have links to specific videos. Additionally , onLinks to videos that I created are only in Blackboard there is a link that takes you to all available videos for the course . Some videos may have quizzes embedded within them. If so, these quizzes are part of your overall grade. You may need to log in with your student credentials to access my videos .
